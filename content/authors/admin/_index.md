# Biography

I'm a physics student whose interests lie at the interface of cosmology, gravity, and field theories. I enjoy doing astronomy education and outreach, and am the current team leader for the Malaysian team at the [International Olympiad on Astronomy and Astrophysics (IOAA)](https://www.ioaastrophysics.org/).

Born and raised in the multicultural furnace of [Malaysia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia), I went on to finish my undergraduate studies at National Tsing Hua University, located on the mesmerising island of [Taiwan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan) —— both of which I highly recommend you to visit!
